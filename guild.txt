pre-condition:
    nodejs
    npm
    yarn
    reactnative
    androidstudio
    qemu
    gradle

Environment preparation (assume u already have the environment for node/react/Cordova):
Install react-native/expo as global
npm install react-native -g
npm install expo -g
npm install expo-cli -g

add react-native into your envrionment path.

goto your project workspace folder
    react-native init YOUR_PROJ_NAME
Then a new folder will be created under workspace, please note this folder should not be existed before the command running.
    cd YOUR_PROJ_NAME

then copy the package.json into your project path then run:
    yarn

!!! This process will cost much time, wait wait wait!

And react-native-camera may need install standalone:
    yarn add react-native-camera

then do the link manually:

    react-native link react-native-vector-icons
    react-native link react-native-device-info
    react-native link react-native-image-picker
    react-native link react-native-amap3d
    react-native link react-native-amap-geolocation
    react-native link react-native-fs
    react-native link react-native-camera
    react-native link react-native-push-notification

make sure all the link is done successfully.

Copy follow code into
    include ':RCTWeChat'
    project(':RCTWeChat').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-wechat/android')
into YOUR_PROJ_NAME\android\settings.gradle

change the value 'minSdkVersion = 16' to in YOUR_PROJ_NAME\android\build.gradle
    minSdkVersion = 21
Note: This action will let your app do not support android 5 or lower version!!!
and add follow code into the file:
    googlePlayServicesVersion = "+"
    firebaseVersion = "+"
    supportLibVersion = 28

Add follow code into
a:
     implementation "androidx.annotation:annotation:1.1.0"
     compile project(':RCTWeChat')
b:
     missingDimensionStrategy 'react-native-camera', 'general' // HYJ add for react-native-camera
into YOUR_PROJ_NAME\android\app\build.gradle


add follow code into
    -keep class com.tencent.mm.sdk.** {
       *;
    }
into YOUR_PROJ_NAME\android\app\proguard-rules.pro

Open YOUR_PROJ_NAME\android\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
add the permission and wechat activity just like the demo project. Also u need to add a meta tag for AMAP's key and several tags for push notification.
Please compare with demo project

Copy follow code into
import com.theweflex.react.WeChatPackage;
packages.add(new WeChatPackage());
into YOUR_PROJ_NAME\android\app\src\main\java\com\YOUR_PROJ_NAME\MainApplication.java
add copy the YOUR_PROJ_NAME\android\app\src\main\java\com\YOUR_PROJ_NAME\wxapi folder to your project
after the copy, modify the java file which under the wxapi folder, for right package string.

go to file YOUR_PROJ_NAME\node_modules\react-native-wechat\android\src\main\java\com\theweflex\react\WeChatModule.java
and file YOUR_PROJ_NAME\node_modules\react-native-amap-geolocation\android\main\java\cn\qiuxiang\react\geolocation\AMapGeolocationModule.java
change code 'import android.support.annotation.Nullable;' to
    //import android.support.annotation.Nullable;
    import androidx.annotation.Nullable;

    and change "@NonNull" to "@Nullable"
Pay attention, this step need to be done while update node modules



copy the assets&res&src folder into the project folder.


copy react-native-highcharts folder from node-modules to src/lib
than modify the code in highcharts:
                a) webview should import from react-native-webview
                b) "this.reRenderWebView.bind(this)" to replace "this.reRenderWebView" to void "this.setState is not a function" issue
